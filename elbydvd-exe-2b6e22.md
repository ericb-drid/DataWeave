The file version 1.0.0.4 is generally considered safe, as it is part of a legitimate program widely used for creating virtual drives; however, like any executable, it can be a target for malware if it has been tampered with or if it is located in an unusual directory. Users may encounter errors related to ElbyDVD.exe, such as issues with mounting images or compatibility problems with certain file formats, but these are typically resolvable through updates or software adjustments.
